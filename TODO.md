- Optimize implementation (now piggybacks on last impl)
- Review docs
- Add toHtmlWithOptions (to set default settings)
- Update example on README.md (needs rebasing with master)
- See if we can do something about Textures/bitmaps with the library
- Fix README links (examples) after publishing and publish a patch version
- _Maybe_
